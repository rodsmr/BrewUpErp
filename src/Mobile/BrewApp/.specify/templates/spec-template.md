# Feature Specification: [FEATURE NAME]

**Feature Branch**: `[###-feature-name]`  
**Created**: [DATE]  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "$ARGUMENTS"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.
  
  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

### User Story 1 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P1)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently - e.g., "Can be fully tested by [specific action] and delivers [specific value]"]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]
2. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

### User Story 2 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P2)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

### User Story 3 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P3)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

[Add more user stories as needed, each with an assigned priority]

### Edge Cases

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right edge cases.
-->

- What happens when [boundary condition]?
- How does system handle [error scenario]?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right functional requirements.
-->

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST [specific capability, e.g., "allow users to create accounts"]
- **FR-002**: System MUST [specific capability, e.g., "validate email addresses"]  
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to [key interaction, e.g., "reset their password"]
- **FR-004**: System MUST [data requirement, e.g., "persist user preferences"]
- **FR-005**: System MUST [behavior, e.g., "log all security events"]

*Example of marking unclear requirements:*

- **FR-006**: System MUST authenticate users via [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: auth method not specified - email/password, SSO, OAuth?]
- **FR-007**: System MUST retain user data for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: retention period not specified]

### Non-Functional Requirements (Mobile-Specific)

#### Performance Requirements *(Per Constitution Principle V)*

- **NFR-P01**: Cold start time MUST be <2s, warm start <1s on target devices [specify devices]
- **NFR-P02**: UI animations/scrolling MUST maintain 60fps
- **NFR-P03**: Active memory footprint MUST NOT exceed 150MB on target devices
- **NFR-P04**: API responses MUST be parsed and rendered within 200ms (p95)
- **NFR-P05**: [Additional performance baselines specific to this feature]

#### UX Consistency Requirements *(Per Constitution Principle III)*

- **NFR-UX01**: All UI components MUST use shared design system components
- **NFR-UX02**: MUST follow platform guidelines (iOS HIG / Material Design)
- **NFR-UX03**: MUST meet WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards (screen reader, dynamic type, contrast)
- **NFR-UX04**: MUST support all target device sizes/orientations with responsive layout
- **NFR-UX05**: Loading states, error messages, success confirmations MUST follow standard patterns
- **NFR-UX06**: MUST be localization-ready (externalized strings, RTL support)

#### Code Quality Requirements *(Per Constitution Principle IV)*

- **NFR-Q01**: MUST pass static analysis with zero warnings (SwiftLint/ESLint/etc.)
- **NFR-Q02**: MUST achieve minimum 80% code coverage (100% for critical paths)
- **NFR-Q03**: Public APIs MUST have documentation comments with usage examples
- **NFR-Q04**: Architecture decisions MUST be documented as ADRs

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **[Entity 1]**: [What it represents, key attributes without implementation]
- **[Entity 2]**: [What it represents, relationships to other entities]

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Define measurable success criteria.
  These must be technology-agnostic and measurable.
-->

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: [Measurable metric, e.g., "Users can complete account creation in under 2 minutes"]
- **SC-002**: [Measurable metric, e.g., "System handles 1000 concurrent users without degradation"]
- **SC-003**: [User satisfaction metric, e.g., "90% of users successfully complete primary task on first attempt"]
- **SC-004**: [Business metric, e.g., "Reduce support tickets related to [X] by 50%"]
- **SC-P01**: [Performance success, e.g., "99% of screen transitions complete within 200ms"]
- **SC-A01**: [Accessibility success, e.g., "100% of interactive elements accessible via screen reader"]
